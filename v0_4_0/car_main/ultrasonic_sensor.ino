Required Libraries:
- http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/NewPing - this library works VERY WELL to read the ultrasonic sensors, but is UNNECESSARILY BLOCKING and UNNECESSARILY USES TIMER2. One of these days I'll fix this by writing my own library that relies on Pin Change interrupts instead, but DOESN'T USE ANY TIMERS and IS NOT BLOCKING. 
- https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_GetMedian - self-explanatory name; is required to implement an external "moving window" type median filter

//Library includes:
#include <NewPing.h>
#include <eRCaGuy_GetMedian.h> //for finding median values 

//Debug defines 
#define SERIAL_PLOTTING_ON //comment out to turn serial plotting prints OFF

//Ultrasonic range-finder "ping" sensor 
const byte TRIGGER_PIN = A5;
const byte ECHO_PIN = A4;
const unsigned int MAX_DISTANCE = 500; //cm; max distance we want to ping for. Maximum sensor distance is rated at 400~500cm.
const float MICROSECONDS_PER_INCH = 74.6422; //us per inch; sound travelling through air at sea level ~GS
const unsigned int DESIRED_PING_PD = 39000; //us; this is the desired sample period; NB: THIS MUST *NOT* BE TOO SHORT, OR ELSE THE PING SENSOR READINGS BECOME *REALLY* UNSTABLE AND LOUSY! See the NewPing library, for instance, which uses a value of 29000us (29ms) (see v1.8 of NewPing.h, line 159) as their fixed sample period when doing their median filter! Also see this datasheet here, "C:\Gabe\Gabe - RC-extra\Arduino\Products (Hardware)\Sensors & Dataloggers (input only)\Distance\Ultrasonic Rangefinder\HC-SR04Users_Manual - Google Docs%%%%%.pdf", which shows in the diagram on pg. 7 that a pulse of 38ms corresponds to "no obstacle". Therefore, let's use a DESIRED_SAMPLE_PD just over 38ms (39ms is good). Note: p. 7 also says "Please make sure the surface of object to be detect should have at least 0.5 meter^2 for better performance." This corresponds to an object ~0.7 x 0.7 m *minimum* in order to provide an adequate reflection surface for best measurements.

unsigned int getUltrasonicDistance()
{
  //Do some basic Digital Signal Processing (DSP):
  //-Get a new distance reading as fast as possible, and load it into a "moving window" raw data buffer; we will then find the median of the data in that buffer and load the median value into a "moving window" median value buffer; lastly, we will come up with a moving average "smoothed" value (which now has increased resolution) by averaging all values in the median value buffer, and we will use that average as the value to output. 
  
  //Raw data sample buffer 
  const byte PING_RAW_BUF_LEN = 5; 
  static unsigned int pingRawBuffer[PING_RAW_BUF_LEN];
  //Median data sample buffer

  static unsigned int pingMedianBuffer[PING_MEDIAN_BUF_LEN];
  
  //Q: What's the median-filtered and smoothed (average-filtered) sample freq? A: For a sample freq of 1/39ms = 25.64 Hz, and a PING_RAW_BUF_LEN of 5 and a PING_MEDIAN_BUF_LEN of 5, we know it takes 9 samples to fully refresh the buffers. This is because the first 5 samples fully replace the pingRawBuffer, *and* we get a good median sample from only new data on that 5th sample, which becomes the first sample in pingMedianBuffer. That means we need 4 more in pingMedianBuffer to completely overwrite its data, so total samples to refresh all data = 5 + 4 = 9 samples. A raw sample rate of 25.64 Hz / 9 samples = 2.85 Hz *guaranteed* frequency response. However, the fact of the matter is that after only 3 good samples in a row, the median value will be one of the 3 new samples out of the 5 possible samples in the pingRawBuffer. Therefore, it is *possible* that we will have only new data comprising our new smoothed value by the time we get only 3 + 4 = 7 samples. This means our frequency response under ideal conditions is 25.64 Hz / 7 samples = 3.66 Hz at best--and as stated before: 2.85 Hz at worst. 
  // float freqResponse = (float)1e6/(float)DESIRED_PING_PD/(PING_RAW_BUF_LEN + PING_MEDIAN_BUF_LEN - 1); //Hz
