Read the latest eventState, debounce it, and update _debouncedAction and _debouncedState as necessary

  0 = NO_ACTION: no change in true, debounced event state since last time interpreting the event, or debounceDelay time not yet elapsed <--*perhaps* in the future, output a 3 to indicate debounceDelay time not yet elapsed
  1 = ACTION_OCCURRED: a new event just occurred (debounceDelay had elapsed)
 -1 = ACTION_UNOCCURRED: event just "un-occurred" by going back to its resting state (debounceDelay had elapsed)
