eRCaGuy_EventReader
-a continuation of eRCaGuy_ButtonReader

ButtonReader Library webpage: http://www.electricrcaircraftguy.com/2014/05/ercaguybuttonreader-library-for-arduino.html
-I wanted a simple and universal, yet very powerful & reliable library to read a button or switch in such a way that I can
 easily implement toggled actions and momentary actions, know the true, debounced state of a button or switch at any given time, 
 and specify whether I want an action to take place when the button is *pressed* or *released.*  This library makes implementing all of
 these things easy for me, and I now use it on all of my projects that require reading a button or switch, so I wanted to share it with others.  Hopefully you find it useful too.

 EventReader Last Updated: 13 Dec 2016 
 
 Version History (newest on top):
  - 20161213 - v2.1.0 released; I am now storing _debouncedAction and _debouncedState right inside the objects! getDebouncedAction() and getDebouncedState() method added. It is no longer necessary to keep track of these outside of the library anymore!
  - 20161213 - v2.0.0 released (first version now called eRCaGuy_EventReader instead of eRCaGuy_ButtonReader); this is a major overhaul and upgrade! This version is now capable of debouncing *any* event instead of just digitalRead inputs on buttons. This means that you can interpret and debounce capacitive touch buttons, or ladders of buttons read as different voltage values on a single analog pin, for instance. This is now possible because instead of letting the library read the button via digitalRead, you just pass in the current button or event state as a 0 or 1 to the library, via the "readEvent" method, and let it interpret and debounce it for you. 
  - 20141031 - v1.1 release; fixed major bug in eRCaGuy_ButtonReader which prevented reading multiple buttons simultaneously from working
  - 20140531 - v1.0 release; first release of eRCaGuy_ButtonReader

	by the way)	here:  http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Debounce
